Assignment 1 part 1:  

Included Files:

	a1part1.cpp
	function.cpp
	lcd_image.h
	lcd_image.cpp
	README

Accessories:

	Arduino Mega2560
	TFT Display
	Joy Stick

Wiring instruction:

	port A8 and A9 should be connected to VRY and VRX respectively,
	and GND to GND, +5V to +5V and port 53 on arduino to SW.

Running instrucion:

	Use make upload in terminal and test the program on the arduino 
	and tft display with the joy cursor

Notes:

	function.cpp includes some of the utilized functions in a1part1.cpp
	to organized the code better. Also I have modified the header file
	because I wanted to use different functions and variables in different
	files. Also Joy cursor re draws itself after patch redraw
